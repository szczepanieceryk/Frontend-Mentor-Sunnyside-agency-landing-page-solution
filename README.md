- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Links

Live demo of a layout

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://szczepanieceryk.github.io/Frontend-Mentor-Sunnyside-agency-landing-page-solution/)

## My process

### Built with

- HTML 5
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

How to change HTML elements order by just CSS ?
That's one way, how to do it :D.

```html
<div className="header-section">
  <div className="egg-section" id="one">
    <img
      className="egg-image"
      src="{EggImage}"
      alt="egg on a yellow background"
    />
  </div>
  <div className="about-us-section" id="two">
    <h3><strong>Transform your brand</strong></h3>
    <span>

      marketing for you.
    </span>
    <a className="lern-more" href="">lern more</a>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.header-section {
  display: flex;
  flex-flow: row;
}
#one {
  order: 2;
}
#two {
  order: 1;
}
```

### Continued development

I would love to cointinue focusing on cool looking layouts and user friendly interfaces, because at the end of a day we want to build solutions for people, to make somebody life easier, right ? üòÅ.
